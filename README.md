CangJie Input Method Library

Installing
==========

This is pretty much a standard Autotools project. You can install it with the
usual sequence:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install

Of course, if you got the sources from Git, you will need to run the
`autogen.sh` script first.

Note: On some multilib-enabled Linux distributions, the 64 bits libraries are
installed in `/usr/lib64`. If building for such a 64 bits distribution, you
should pass the `--libdir=/usr/lib64` parameter to the `configure` script.

Dependencies
============

You will need the following to build this library:

  - the C++ libdb bindings:
      -> http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/

  - a C++ compiler
      We strongly recomment g++
      -> http://gcc.gnu.org/
